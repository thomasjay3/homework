# Death saves are a little different than normal saving throws. 
# If your health drops to 0 or below, you are unconscious and may die. 
# Each time it is your turn, roll a d20 to determine if you get closer 
# to life or fall deeper into death. If the number is less than 10, you
# record a "failure". If the number is 10 or greater, you record a "success". 
# If you collect 3 failures, you "die". If you collect 3 successes, you are "stable"
# but unconscious. If you are unlucky and roll a 1, it counts as 2 failures.
# If you're lucky and roll a 20, you gain 1 health and have "revived". 
# Write a program that simulates death saves. 
# What is the probability you die, stabilize, or revive?
